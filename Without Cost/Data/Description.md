We ran the simulation for two different training times, 10000 and 20000. For each run, we save the updated Q-tables every 1000 timesteps

Each run generates files that describe the temporal evolution of the following quantities:

1. Delta
1. The Q-tables
1. The birds' average velocity
1. The birds' instincts/ flying directional preferences
