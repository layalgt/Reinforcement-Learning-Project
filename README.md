This is the repository corresponding to the Reinforcement Learning course project. 

The project, "Studying the Flockig of Birds from a Multi-Agenet Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Perspective", uses the Q-learning algorithm in an MARL framework to explore whether it is capable of reproducing emergent flocking behaviors, such as alignment, in a collecctive of birds.

The work builds heavily on [andredelft/flock-learning](https://github.com/andredelft/flock-learning) and introduces a slight modification to the original codebase. In particular, we add a cost associated with bird collisions and compare the resulting behavior with that obtained in the absence of penalty.

Note on the use of AI: ChatGPT was used to assist with technical commands related to creating ZIP files for saving generated results, and for adjusting image scaling parameters.
