Below, is a brief description of the project for the Reinforcement Learning course at ICTP, QLS section, July 2025\\
The title project is "Studying the Flockig of Birds from a Multi-Agenet Reinforcement Learning Perspective"\\
This project is based heavily on [andredelft/flock-learning](https://github.com/andredelft/flock-learning) where we use the same code but add a cost to the reward resulting from the \\
collision of two birds.
