Below, is a brief description of the project for the Reinforcement Learning course at ICTP, QLS section, July 2025

The title project is "Studying the Flockig of Birds from a Multi-Agenet Reinforcement Learning Perspective"

This project is based heavily on [andredelft/flock-learning](https://github.com/andredelft/flock-learning) where we use the same code but add a cost to the reward resulting from the collision of two birds.

Note: On the use of AI, I used ChatGPT for help in commands related to creating zip files to save the generated results, as well as for obtaining proper image scaling like figsize etc...
